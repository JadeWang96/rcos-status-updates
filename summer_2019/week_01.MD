## Last Week's Accomplishments


> This past week, I began to learn Rust and pratice some examples in the book. \
> And also I learned how to use the GitHub and found 2 issues in the project.

## This Week's Plan

> I plan to go through the Rust book ASAP and understand the most part of this project. \
> I also will learn how to fix a bug and merge the branch in the GitHub.


## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Part of project is related to the other programming language, such as the API to database. \
> I am quite unfamiliar with this kind of combination. I may go through firstly and look for mentor's help.
