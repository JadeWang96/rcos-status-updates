## Last Week's Accomplishments


> This past week, I still try to go through the book and practice of Rust. \
> And I began to work on a enhancement issue on GitHub and created a draft sitemap by HTML.

## This Week's Plan

> I plan to go through the Rust book ASAP. \
> Based on the current sitemap draft, I will optimize the interface and add more link. \



## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> I haven't used fork() and pull request before, I will ask for help when I finish my part.
